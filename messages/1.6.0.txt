SublimeLinter-tslint 1.6.0
-------------------------------

Removed the "config" and "project" settings.
In stead, they can be set using the "args" setting:

"tslint": {
	"args": ["--project", "${folder}"]
}

Note, that you need to set the --project arg if you want to enable
project based linting. This also enables rules that require the type checker.
